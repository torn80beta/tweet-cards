<h1 align="center"> Welcome to TweetCards demo page! <img src="https://github.com/torn80beta/tweet-cards/raw/main/src/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>

 <p>This is a demo project that can be used as part of a larger project. It demonstrates the ability to view a list of social network users stored in a database.</p>
 <p>Each user's card reflects the user's Avatar, the number of "Tweets" and the number of the user's Followers.</p>
 <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/torn80beta/tweet-cards/raw/main/src/images/card.jpg" height="300" /></div>
 <p>The "Follow" button displays the subscription status for this user. If you are subscribed - the button is green and the inscription is "Following". When clicking on the button in this state, the user will be unsubscribed, the color of the button will change to pale pink, and the number of subscribers will decrease by one.</p>

 <p>By default, when you go to the "TWEETS" page, the first five cards from the database are loaded. At the same time, the "Load more" button will appear at the bottom of the page, when clicked, the next five cards will be loaded. The "Load more" button only appears if the server still has cards available for download. The button is also not available during the server request process.</p>
 
 <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/torn80beta/tweet-cards/raw/main/src/images/load_more.jpg" height="80" /></div>
 
 <p>The user has the ability to filter already loaded cards using the "Filter" interface located on the top panel. If you select the "Follow" option, only the cards of users for which the subscription has not yet been issued will be displayed. If you select the "Following" option, cards of users with an active subscription will be displayed. In both cases, the "Load more" button will be disabled. Selecting the "All" option will display all currently loaded cards and a "Load more" button will appear at the bottom of the list.</p>

 <p>The application has a responsive design and can be comfortably used on devices with a screen width of 400px.
When the screen width is less than 600px, the navigation buttons located on the top bar are moved to a modal menu, which is available by clicking on the "Burger Menu" icon. At the same time, for ease of use, the filtering interface remains available on the top panel.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to the project! I hope you enjoy it.</p>
